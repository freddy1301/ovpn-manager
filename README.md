âœ… Easy to use

âœ… Installs everything for you

âœ… Keeps System clean

âœ… Fancy looking âœ¨ ASCII Art âœ¨

âœ… Removes leftover Configuration files

ðŸ”¶ Does not handle errors very well :/

### What do I need?
1. Sudo and Docker Privileges on your system
2. Screen Installed

### How to Install
Just download the file straight from the main branch and run it on your OpenVPN Server.

It will work as a normal user with sudo privileges but wont be able to put your configurations into /opt/openvpn/clients

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freddy1301/ovpn-manager/main/ovpn-manager.sh && chmod +x ovpn-manager.sh && sudo apt update && sudo apt install screen -y && ./ovpn-manager.sh
```
